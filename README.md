## Boozt QA practical challenge

Congratulations, you have reached the next stage which is solving a Boozt practical challenge.

During the challenge execution, we want you to imagine yourself as a member of our team,
with a collective goal of getting your tasks completed :sunny:

This challenge includes:
3 main sections: Theoretical, Manual testing and Automated testing 

execution may take up to 4 hours

Let’s start!

---

## Theoretical part

For this part, you don't need any additional devices or apps 
only your knowledge and any text editor

##

*Description:* 
You have gotten a totally new *Login* feature inside of our Android app, 
please describe how you will test it 
(it is enough to provide a test plan without concrete test cases)

##

here is how the feature looks:

---

## Manual part

For this part, you will need:
- Your preferred tool to provide us with the results
- Android Studio to build the app (this is the preferred way to get the app, but it is also possible to download the apk from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pDaCda8w8bcnBjMT2YMnPkQmQ59yxy_y/view?usp=drive_link))


##
*Description:* 

We are in the middle of the sprint and the following 2 user stories were just moved to the QA
testing column on our Jira board:

##

#### Story 1: As a user, I want to log in to the app

Scenarios:

1. **User opens the app**
   - GIVEN: the user opens the app for the first time (when not logged in yet)
   - THEN: login screen with a user name and password entries and login button is displayed
2. **User login failed**
   - GIVEN: the user provided the wrong username and/or password
   - WHEN: login button is clicked
   - THEN: error markers are displayed by user name and/or password entries

3. **User login succeed (credentials provided below)**
   - GIVEN: the user provided the right username and password
   - WHEN: login button is clicked
   - THEN: the user is taken to the cat breeds screen

4. **User opens the app**
   - GIVEN: the user opens the app next time (when previously logged in)
   - THEN: the user is taken straight to the cat breeds screen

##

#### Story 2: As a user, I want to see cat breeds


Scenarios:

1. **Cats images are loaded**
   - GIVEN: the user successfully logged in to the app
   - WHEN: there is an internet connection
   - THEN: images are displayed in the rows on the list (a row can have one or more images that are horizontally scrollable)

2. **Failed to load images**
   - GIVEN: the user successfully logged in to the app
   - WHEN: there is no internet connection
   - THEN: “failed to load cat breeds” error message and a Retry button displayed 

3. **Cat breed card is clicked**
   - GIVEN: the cat's images are successfully loaded on the screen
   - WHEN: the user clicks one of the images
   - THEN: the user is navigated to the cat breed details screen with clicked breed info loaded

##

#### Login credentials

- **for user1:**  user1 / password
- **for user2:**  user2 / password

##

Now it’s your turn. You need to verify if we can move these two user stories to the Done column on our Jira
board.
We expect that if you find any bugs, they will be reported in clear form

---

## Automatomation

In this part, automate at least one scenario from User stories in the Manual part
Recommendation: take the User story 1 and scenario 3

If you will cover more than 1 Scenario it will be a bonus

fork of this repository and open the PR with your solution into the main branch 

##

*Description:*

The app code is written on Kotlin language with Compose
Please use native tools for your test or any other tool of your choosing (but explain why)
Please create your own repo and share the solution with us

* At Boozt we love clean code, so please try to write your tests neatly.

* It’s not mandatory but using an additional abstraction level for your tests (like your own
  framework to facilitate writing tests) will be very much appreciated

* As a note, we won't consider any automation task submission created with a test recorder.

##

At Boozt we highly appreciate good communication at all times so, if you have any questions, don’t
hesitate to ask

## Good luck :four_leaf_clover:!
